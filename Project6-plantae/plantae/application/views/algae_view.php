                <h2>About Algae</h2>
                <p>
                    Aglae is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic.
                    Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants.
                    The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae.

                <h2>Classification</h2>
                <p>
                    Most algae contain chloroplasts that are similar in structure to cyanobacteria. 
                    Chloroplasts contain circular DNA like that in cyanobacteria and presumably 
                    represent reduced endosymbiotic cyanobacteria. However, the exact origin of the 
                    chloroplasts is different among separate lineages of algae, reflecting their 
                    acquisition during different endosymbiotic events. The table below describes the 
                    composition of the three major groups of algae. Their lineage relationships are 
                    shown in the figure in the upper right. Many of these groups contain some members 
                    that are no longer photosynthetic. Some retain plastids, but not chloroplasts, 
                    while others have lost plastids entirely.

                    W.H.Harvey (1811â€”1866) and Lamouroux (1813) were the first to divide macroscopic 
                    algae into four divisions based on their pigmentation. This is the first use of a 
                    biochemical criterion in plant systematics. Harvey's four divisions are: 
                    red algae (Rhodospermae), brown algae (Melanospermae), green algae (Chlorospermae),
                    and Diatomaceae.

                <p>
                    Most of the simpler algae are unicellular flagellates or amoeboids, but colonial 
                    and nonmotile forms have developed independently among several of the groups. 
                    Some of the more common organizational levels, more than one of which may occur in 
                    the lifecycle of a species, are

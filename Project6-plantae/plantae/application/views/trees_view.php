                <h2>About Trees</h2>
                <p>
                    In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, 
                    supporting branches and leaves in most species. In some usages, the definition 
                    of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with secondary growth, 
                    plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. Trees are 
                    not a taxonomic group but include a variety of plant species that have 
                    independently evolved a woody trunk and branches as a way to tower above other 
                    plants to compete for sunlight. In looser senses, the taller palms, the tree ferns, 
                    bananas and bamboos are also trees.

                <h2>Definition</h2>
                <p>
                    Although "tree" is a term of common parlance, there is no universally recognised 
                    precise definition of what a tree is, either botanically or in common language.
                    In its broadest sense, a tree is any plant with the general form of an elongated 
                    stem, or trunk, which supports the photosynthetic leaves or branches at some 
                    distance above the ground. Trees are also typically defined by height, with smaller 
                    plants from 0.5 to 10 m (1.6 to 32.8 ft) being called shrubs, so the minimum 
                    height of a tree is only loosely defined. Large herbaceous plants such as 
                    papaya and bananas are trees in this broad sense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Under such a definition, herbaceous plants such as palms, bananas and papayas 
                    are not considered trees regardless of their height, growth form or stem girth. 
                    Certain monocots may be considered trees under a slightly looser definition; 
                    while the Joshua tree, bamboos and palms do not have secondary growth and never 
                    produce true wood with growth rings, they may produce "pseudo-wood" by lignifying 
                    cells formed by primary growth.

                <h2>Distribution</h2>
                <p>
                    The number of trees in the world, according to a 2015 estimate, is 3.04 trillion,
                    of which 1.39 trillion (46%) are in the tropics or sub-tropics, 0.61 trillion (20%)
                    in the temperate zones, and 0.74 trillion (24%) in the coniferous boreal forests. 
                    The estimate is about eight times higher than previous estimates, and is based on 
                    tree densities measured on over 400,000 plots. It remains subject to a wide margin 
                    of error, not least because the samples are mainly from Europe and North America. 
                    The estimate suggests that about 15 billion trees are cut down annually and about 
                    5 billion are planted. In the 12,000 years since the start of human agriculture, 
                    the number of trees worldwide has decreased by 46%.
